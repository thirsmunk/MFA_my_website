      <description>Challenge 1: CDC COVID-19 Public Use Data Let us revisit the CDC Covid-19 Case Surveillance Data. There are well over 3 million entries of individual, de-identified patient data. Since this is a large file, I suggest you use vroom to load it and you keep cache=TRUE in the chunk options.
# file contains 11 variables and 3.66m rows and is well over 380Mb. # It will take time to download # URL link to CDC to download data url &amp;lt;- &amp;quot;https://data.</description>

      <description>This project was done to research whether the IMDB rating for blockbuster movies were influenced by the director. Before looking at any kind of data, a null hypothesis and alternative hypothesis were set up as follows:
 H0 there is no difference in the mean IMDB-rating for movies produced by Steven Spielberg or Tim Burton.
 Ha There is a significant difference between these mean IMDB-ratings.
  A big dataset was provided with movies from all genres by many different directors.</description>
